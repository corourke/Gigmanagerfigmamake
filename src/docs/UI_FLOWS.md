# UI Flows & User Experience

## Overview

This document describes user flows, screen specifications, and UI patterns. All flows are designed for both web (desktop/tablet) and mobile platforms, with database field mappings included for code generation guidance.

## Authentication & Organization Management

### Flow 1: User Login & Organization Selection

**User Journey:**

1. User visits app → Redirected to `/login`
2. User sees login options:
   - "Sign in with Google" (OAuth)

3. After authentication:
   - If new user and no profile exists → Profile completion screen
   - If profile exists → Check organization memberships
4. Organization selection:
   - If user belongs to organizations → Show organization picker
   - If no organizations → "Create your first organization" screen
5. User selects organization → Redirect to dashboard

**Database Fields Involved:**
- `users` table: `id`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`
- `organization_members` table: `organization_id`, `user_id`, `role`
- `organizations` table: `id`, `name`, `type`

**Screens Required:**

## Common Patterns Across Flows

### List → Detail → Edit Pattern
- Most entities follow: List view → Click item → Detail view → Edit button → Edit form
- Mobile: Often combine detail/edit in one view with inline editing

### Search & Filter Pattern
- Consistent search input placement
- Filter dropdowns/collapsible sections
- Clear filters button
- Results count display

### Create/Edit Form Pattern
- Consistent form layout and validation
- Save/Cancel buttons
- Loading states during submission
- Success redirect or toast notification
- Error handling with inline validation

### Status Management Pattern
- Status badges with color coding
- Status transition dropdowns/modals
- Validation of allowed transitions
- History/logging of changes

## UI Component Guidelines

### shadcn/ui Usage

**Common Components:**
- Button - Actions and form submissions
- Input, Textarea - Form inputs
- Select - Dropdown selections
- Checkbox, RadioGroup - Boolean and single-choice inputs
- Card - Container for content
- Dialog - Modal dialogs
- Table - Data tables
- Badge - Status indicators
- Skeleton - Loading states
- Toast - Notifications

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"

export function GigCard({ gig }) {
  return (
    <Card className="p-4">
      <h3 className="font-semibold">{gig.title}</h3>
      <Button onClick={() => router.push(`/gigs/${gig.id}`)}>
        View Details
      </Button>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

### Common UI Patterns

**List Views:**
- Search input with icon
- Filter controls (dropdowns, date pickers)
- Results grid/table
- Empty state with CTA
- Loading skeletons
- Pagination or infinite scroll

**Form Views:**
- Clear form structure with sections
- Inline validation errors
- Loading state on submit button
- Success toast notification
- Cancel button returns to previous page

**Empty States:**
```typescript
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-12 text-center">
  <Icon className="h-12 w-12 text-muted-foreground mb-4" />
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">No gigs found</h3>
  <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
    Get started by creating your first gig.
  </p>
  <Button onClick={handleCreate}>Create Gig</Button>
</div>
```

## Responsive Design Patterns

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 0px - 767px (default, mobile-first)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+

**Common Patterns:**
```typescript
// Grid that adapts to screen size
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

// Hide on mobile, show on desktop
<div className="hidden md:block">

// Stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">

// Responsive text sizing
<h1 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl">
```

## Form Patterns

### React Hook Form + Zod

All forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation:

```typescript
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { gigFormSchema } from "@/lib/validations/gigs"

export function GigForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(gigFormSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      title: "",
      status: "DateHold",
      // ...
    },
  })

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/orgs/${orgId}/gigs`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    })
    // Handle response
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <Input {...form.register("title")} />
      {form.formState.errors.title && (
        <p className="text-red-600 text-sm">
